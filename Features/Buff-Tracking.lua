    loaded) -- we return nil so the caller drops the event entirely. Trap: do NOT
    fall back to the pet itself. Its name is not a player's, so the thank-you
    whisper bounces ("No player named 'Woofbark' is currently playing") and the
    print credits an animal; and because a pet inherits its owner's PARTY/RAID

    Group services are announced from UNIT_SPELLCAST_SUCCEEDED, not the combat log:
    portals, summons, feasts and the like are utility casts that don't reliably
    produce a SPELL_CAST_SUCCESS in COMBAT_LOG_EVENT_UNFILTERED, but they DO fire
    this unit event for any unit the client tracks (party/raid, target, focus). A
    service has no per-you target, so crediting the casting unit is all we need --
    which is also why solo casts (Rebirth, Lay on Hands) stay on the combat log,
    where the destination tells us the buff actually landed on you.

    That same breadth is why the caster is filtered to your party or raid below:
    the event's reach is much wider than the feature's, and a service cast by
    someone you merely have targeted was never meant to announce.

    The per-source "service:" cooldown does double duty: it rate-limits a mage
    opening several portals in a row, and it dedupes the multiple tokens a single
    cast can fire (party1 and target for the same caster resolve to one GUID, so the
