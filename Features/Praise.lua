    Per-recipient whisper throttle. Whispers go to OTHER players, so unlike the
    self-only prints (which fire on every buff) they must not repeat: a player who
    rebuffs you several times is thanked at most once per window, which also keeps
    us clear of Blizzard's whisper spam squelch. Keyed by GUID under a "whisper:"
    namespace so it never collides with the praise/service cooldowns on the same
    GUID, and it sits underneath the user-set praise cooldowns as a floor they
    cannot lower. Checks and stamps in one call, and only stamps when a whisper is
    actually cleared to send, so the window is measured from the last whisper we sent.

-- Emote Target
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--[[
    Could this unit actually witness an emote? Holding a unit token proves the
    buffer exists, not that they are anywhere near you -- a party member who
    zoned into a dungeon, or ran two zones ahead, is still "party2".

    Two gates, both cheap. UnitIsVisible is the coarse one: it goes false the
    moment the client stops tracking the object, which is exactly the different
    zone / different instance / different continent case. UnitInRange is the
    tighter one at roughly spell range, but it answers only for group members --
    its second return says whether it checked at all, so a stranger falls
    through to the visibility verdict instead of to a bogus false.

    Deliberately looser than true emote range (emote text broadcasts at say
    range, far shorter than either check). Nothing in the API measures that, and
    erring loose costs an emote nobody sees, while erring tight silently drops
    thanks the buffer WAS standing there for -- the worse failure for an addon
    whose whole job is thanking people.

    On WoW Forever UnitInRange answers a stranger with secret booleans even out
    of combat, and a boolean test on one errors. A secret verdict counts as
    "didn't check", the same as a stranger on the other flavors.

    Best emote direction for a buffer: their unit token when we hold one, else
    their bare character name. The client resolves a name to any player it can
    currently see -- but only the bare form, never the combat log's cross-realm
    "Name-Realm", so the realm is stripped. Worst realistic miss is two visible
    same-named players from different realms, which just salutes the wrong twin.

    Returning nil means "do not emote", not "emote undirected" -- DoRandomEmote
    enforces that. A unit token we hold but that cannot witness the emote is
    dropped here rather than degraded, because degrading it produces "You thank
    everyone around you." aimed at nobody.

    Caveat on the name branch: no API pre-tests whether a name will resolve, and
    C_ChatInfo.PerformEmote does not report how it resolved one, so an absent
    stranger still reaches it as a name and still degrades to the undirected
    emote. That
    hole closes only by dropping the name fallback entirely, which would also
    drop the ordinary case of a stranger buffing you while standing right there
    untargeted -- the addon's most common thank of all.

--[[
    Send the praise: the thank-you whisper, the emote, or both. Every gate -- the
    toggles, the cooldowns, the whisper throttle, the combat check -- is settled
    by the caller before the timer is armed, so the Praise Delay holds back
    delivery only; a burst of buffs can't slip past a cooldown by landing inside
    the delay window.

    Two things are deliberately decided late instead, when the emote actually
    fires. Combat, because the promise on that toggle is that an emote never
    plays while you are fighting. And the emote target: ResolveEmoteTarget hands
    back a live unit token, and "target", "focus", and "mouseover" all name
    whoever you are pointing at in that instant -- resolve it early and a delayed
    emote thanks whoever you moved on to. An unresolvable buffer degrades to
    their bare name, and from there to no emote at all -- never to the
    undirected one.
