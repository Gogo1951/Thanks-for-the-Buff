    The manual thank-you feature: auto-created macros and the /thankyou commands
    that emote at and whisper your current target. Core's login sequence calls
    CreateAutoMacro; Options/Options.lua registers the slash commands against
    RunThankYou.

    There are several independent buttons, listed in Data.THANK_YOU_BUTTONS --
    each with its own macro, command, whisper text and emote selection, so one
    can thank a stranger and another can heckle a guildmate. Nothing here knows
    how many there are.

-- Auto Macro
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--[[
    Bring every button's macro in line with the profile: create the ones switched
    on that are missing, delete the ones switched off that are still there. Runs
    at login and on every profile change, so a profile switch moves the macros
    with it instead of leaving the previous profile's on the bars until a reload.

    The global macro cap is re-read inside the loop, not hoisted: each macro this
    creates counts against it, so five buttons enabled at once on a nearly-full
    list must stop at the real limit rather than at the count taken before any of
    them existed.

    Remove one button's macro, for when its Create Macro toggle is turned off.

    Deletes by INDEX resolved from this button's exact name, never by a name
    match at delete time: DeleteMacro accepts a name, but resolving first lets
    the "does it exist" check and the delete agree on the same macro, and makes
    the no-op case explicit rather than relying on DeleteMacro tolerating a name
    that isn't there.

    Combat-guarded like creation is -- the macro API is unavailable in combat, so
    a toggle flipped mid-fight simply leaves the macro alone rather than erroring.
