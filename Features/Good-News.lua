--[[
    Good News whispers for tracked buffs YOU cast on another player.

    Driven by UNIT_SPELLCAST_SENT + UNIT_SPELLCAST_SUCCEEDED, NOT the combat log.
    Trap: the combat log is scoped to you, your group, and units in combat, so
    buffing a player outside your group produces no SPELL_AURA_APPLIED at all --
    the single most common case for this feature is exactly the one the combat
    log never reports. SENT is also the only event that names the recipient;
    SUCCEEDED then confirms the cast actually went off, so an interrupted cast
    stays silent.

    Deduped per recipient+spell so a quick recast doesn't whisper twice.

local GOODNEWS_DEDUP = 10

--[[
    UNIT_SPELLCAST_SENT names the recipient but gives neither unit nor GUID. Map
    the name back to a unit we hold, which is what lets us confirm the recipient
    is a player (buffing a pet must stay silent -- it has nobody to read the
    whisper) and read the buff's duration off them afterwards. Ordered by how
    people actually cast: at your target, a mouseover/focus macro, then a group
    member by unit token.

        The aura is applied a beat after the cast succeeds, so reading it now
        would report "no duration" for every buff. Wait a tick, then read it off
        the recipient -- re-checking the unit still holds their GUID, since they
        may have been untargeted in the meantime. A no-aura cast (Rebirth), an
        unreadable one, and one whose auras or identity are secret all fall
        through to the duration-less flavor.

    The other half of a resurrect-detect Good News whisper. UNIT_SPELLCAST_SUCCEEDED
    parks the record instead of announcing it, because a jumper-cable cast succeeds
    whether or not the target gets up; this is the combat-log event that only a
    working jolt produces, so it is what releases the whisper.

    Matched on recipient + spell rather than castGUID, which the combat log does
    not carry. Swept first so a failed jolt's stale record can never be claimed by
    a later revive of the same person with the same cables.

--[[
    Good News for a cast of yours. "Yours" includes your PET's: Roar of Sacrifice
    and Battle Squawk are cast by the pet, never by the player, so a bare
    unit == "player" test silently switched Good News off for every pet-cast
    entry in the data -- the recipient sees the buff and hears nothing.

    Nothing downstream needs to know which of the two it was. The whisper names
    the buff, not the caster, and the recipient's experience is identical either
    way; crediting the owner is the whole point of tracking a pet's cast at all.
    Core registers UNIT_SPELLCAST_SENT for "player" and "pet" only, and "pet"
    means yours, so no other caster reaches here.
